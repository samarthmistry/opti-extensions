A collection of custom data structures and user-friendly functions for mathematical optimization modeling with [docplex](https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/docplex-doc), [gurobipy](https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/current/reference/python.html), and [xpress](https://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/optimizer/python/HTML).

Features
--------

* **Specialized data structures**: For defining index-sets, parameters, and decision variables enabling concise and high-performance algebraic modeling — compatible across different solver APIs.
* **Easy access to additional CPLEX functionality**: Like [tuning tool](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/latest?topic=programmingconsiderations-tuning-tool), [runseeds](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/latest?topic=cplex-evaluating-variability), [displaying problem statistics](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/latest?topic=problem-displaying-statistics), and [displaying solution quality statistics](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/latest?topic=cplex-evaluating-solution-quality) — not directly available in DOcplex.
* **Type-complete interface**: Enables static type checking and intelligent auto-completion suggestions with modern IDEs — reducing type errors and improving development speed.
* **Robust codebase**: 100% coverage spanning 2500+ test cases and fully type-checked with mypy under [strict mode](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#strict-mode-and-configuration).
